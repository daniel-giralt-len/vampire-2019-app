## What is this?

The world of Vampire: The Masquerade is canonically set in the world of today. That means usage of smartphones is encouraged in-game.

In my sessions, my GM would allow to actually use our phone to communicate through texts without being seen by the NPCs.

This app hopes to improve the experience by providing information on the chapters without breaking immersion.
